Welcome to my portfolio website! This is a personal project I created to showcase my skills, projects, and growth as a web developer. The site is live and accessible [here](https://z1ko-ai.github.io/Zakaria.Zebbara.github.io/).

## About the Project

This portfolio website is my first major project, created after learning HTML and CSS for about three months. It represents my initial steps into the world of web development and serves as a platform to display:
- My projects
- My skills
- Ways to connect with me

## Features

- **Responsive Layout (in progress)**: Currently optimized for desktops, with improvements for mobile compatibility coming soon.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Easy-to-use navigation to explore different sections.
- **Live Hosting**: Hosted on GitHub Pages for public access.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structured the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styled and formatted the design.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used for hosting and sharing the project.

## What I Learned
- Structuring webpages with HTML
- Styling using CSS, including layouts and typography
- Deploying a website using GitHub Pages
- Basics of design principles for creating user-friendly websites

## Next Steps
I am continually improving this project as I learn more about:
